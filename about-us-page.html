                    <h2>The Origins of Zumba</h2>
                    <p>Picture this: a dance-loving Colombian named Beto, a forgotten aerobics playlist, and a sprinkle of Latin magic. That's how Zumba burst onto the scene!</p>
        
                    <p>In the '90s, Beto Perez, a dance enthusiast, walked into an aerobics class without his usual music. Instead of panicking, he cranked up his Latin tunes and improvised some heart-pumping moves.</p>
        
                    <p>People couldn't resist the catchy beats and infectious energy. Soon, Zumba was born! From the streets of Cali to fitness studios worldwide, it's a dance revolution like no other.</p>
        
                    <p>Get ready to groove, laugh, and sweat with us as we celebrate the joyous journey of Zumba!</p>
